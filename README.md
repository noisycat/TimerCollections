Simple stop watch style timercollection set meant for being able to manually time various parts of your routines while keeping them organized in a collective.
Templated for use with whatever style timer you want, derive from defaultStopWatch and implement the required pure virtuals. The defaultTimer utilizes std::chron::steady_clock.
As such, the project requires C++11 or higher. Include TimerCollections.hpp and you'll be off to the races!

Will add a Doxygen later. More for me than for anyone else :-D
